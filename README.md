# IoT Based Patient Health Monitoring System using LPC2129

An IoT-based patient health monitoring system developed using the **LPC2129 (ARM7)** microcontroller. The project continuously monitors vital health parameters such as **Heart Rate**, **SpO2**, **Body Temperature**, and **Distance**, displays them on an LCD, and transmits the collected data over Wi-Fi for remote monitoring.

## Functional Overview

The system continuously performs the following operations:

1. Initializes LCD, UART, I2C, GPIO, and peripherals.
2. Reads temperature from the DHT11 sensor.
3. Collects Red and IR samples from the MAX30102 sensor.
4. Calculates Heart Rate and SpO2 using signal-processing algorithms.
5. Measures distance using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.
6. Displays sensor readings on the LCD.
7. Sends sensor data through UART/Wi-Fi for IoT monitoring.
8. Activates the warning LED and buzzer whenever abnormal conditions are detected.
